Produce a web application to generate project code names based on a letter of the alphabet (input via textbox), using the poke-api, following the supplied design.

Project code names should be alliterative in the format: "Adjective Pokemon"

eg: H could return: "Hungry Haunter" or "Happy Horsea" and B may return "Bouncing Bulbasaur" or "Bright Bulbasaur"

Pokemon details ( Sprite and stats) should be pulled dynamically from the PokeApi https://pokeapi.co/ Documentation is available at https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/

The font used is Roboto Condensed at size and weights. H1 - 48px/Bold H2 - 40px/Bold H3 - 20px/Bold Body - 20px/Regular

Colours used are: #016EC1 #FFCA00

Spacing is based on an 8px grid.
